Welcome to teili's documentation!
=================================
teili, das /taÉªli/
swiss german diminutive for piece.

This toolbox was developed to provide computational neuroscientists, as well as neuromorphic engineers, a play ground for neuronally implemented algorithms which are simulated using brian2. By providing pre-defined neural algorithms and an intuitive way to combine different aspects of those algorithms, e.g. plasticity, connectivity etc, we try to shorten the production time of novel neural algorithms. Furthermore, by providing an easy and modular way to construct those algorithms from the basic building blocks of computaton, e.g. neurons and synapses, we aim to reduce the gap between software simulation and hardware emulation
