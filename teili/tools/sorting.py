"""To understand the structure of in the rasterplots but also in the learned weight matrices, we need to sort the weight matrices according to some similarity measure, such as euclidean distance.
However, the sorting algorithm is completely agnostic to the similarity measure. It connects each node with maximum two edges and constructs a directed graph.
This is similar to the travelling salesman problem.

Example:
    In order to use this class you need to initialize it
    either without a filename:

    >>> from teili.tools.sorting import SortMatrix
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> matrix = np.random.randint((49, 49))
    >>> obj = SortMatrix(nrows=49, matrix=matrix)
    >>> print(obj.matrix)
    >>> print(obj.permutation)
    >>> print(ob.sorted_matrix)

    or instead of using a matrix you can also specify a
    path to a stored matrix:

    >>> filename = '/path/to/your/matrix.npy'
    >>> obj = SortMatrix(nrows=49, filename=filename)
